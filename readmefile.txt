Improvements

Better report generations 
group all Given , when , then , And - functions in seperate java file
group all the reusable functional in one java file , so that functions can be reused. 
if we use Java 8 , string validations will be much easier
group all the global variable in common properties eg : Sleep , Url , paths ( so it is easier to change the URl depending of the environment tested )
can test for multiple browsers
framework can be extened for API testing 



testing coverage 
Can cover more edge cases - but no enough time to coverage 


Req Not clear: 
Daily forecast should summarise the 3 hour data:  - not sure what are the calculation used in the application but for rounding down have to use -  Math.floor
